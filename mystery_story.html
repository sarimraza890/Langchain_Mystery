<h1>The Blackwood Manor Mystery</h1>
<p><em>A Detective Puzzle Story</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1: The Silent Manor</h2>
<p>
Blackwood Manor stood on the edge of Ravenhill like a forgotten memory. On a stormy night,
renowned historian Dr. Elias Crow was found dead in his locked study. The room showed no signs
of forced entry. A shattered antique clock lay beside him, stopped at exactly 11:40 PM.
</p>

<p>
Three people were inside the manor that night: Amelia Crow, the victim’s niece; Victor Hale,
his business partner; and Mrs. Dalton, the long-serving housekeeper. Each claimed innocence,
yet all carried secrets.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: The Clues</h2>
<p>
Detectives found muddy footprints leading to the library, though no one admitted entering it.
A torn page from an old journal was discovered in the fireplace, partially burned. The last
readable line said: “The truth lies behind the clock.”
</p>

<p>
Amelia claimed she was in her room listening to music with headphones. Victor insisted he left
the manor before 11 PM, but his car engine was still warm. Mrs. Dalton stated she was preparing
tea, yet the kettle was cold.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Hidden Truths</h2>
<p>
Upon closer inspection, the antique clock concealed a hidden compartment containing legal
documents. They revealed that Dr. Crow planned to remove Victor from the company and leave
everything to Amelia.
</p>

<p>
However, fingerprints on the clock belonged not to Victor, but to Amelia. Her headphones were
never plugged in. She had overheard everything.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: The Resolution</h2>
<p>
Confronted with evidence, Amelia confessed. In a heated argument, she pushed her uncle, causing
him to fall and strike the clock. Panic led her to stage the scene.
</p>

<p>
The mystery of Blackwood Manor was solved — not by force, but by carefully connecting facts,
timelines, and silence.
