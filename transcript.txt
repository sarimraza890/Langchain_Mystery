Blackwood Manor stood alone on the edge of Ravenhill Town.
On the night of October fourteenth, during a violent storm, Dr. Elias Blackwood was found dead inside his locked study.

The cause of death was poison, mixed into his evening tea.
The study door was locked from the inside, and the key was found in Elias’s pocket.

Four people were inside the manor that night: his sister Margaret, his assistant Thomas, the housekeeper Lena, and his business partner Victor.

Each had a motive, each had an alibi.

The power went out at nine twenty PM.
The study clock stopped at nine thirty-two.
Muddy footprints were found outside the window, but matched no one’s shoes.

Elias never prepared his own tea.
And only one person knew where the poison was kept.

This was not a crime of anger—
it was a crime to stop the truth from being revealed.
